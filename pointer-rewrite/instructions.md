# Instructions  

The following function uses reference variables as parameters. Rewrite the function so it uses pointers instead of reference variables, then demonstrate the function in a complete program.

```C
int doSomething(int *x, int *y)
{
    int temp = *x;
    *x = *y * 10;
    *y = temp * 10;
    return *x + *y;
}
```
